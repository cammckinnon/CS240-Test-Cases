### lol what's this repo for
Sample input and output to help you test your Spring 2012 CS240 assignments (at the time of this writing I'm a student in that class).

### Are you that the outputs are correct?
Some of the same input/output is taken directly from the assignment specs. The rest (both input and output) is generated by a python script I wrote, and then tested against my c++ assignment solution. So it should be cool unless I misunderstood the assignment question. Soon I hope to be able to post the python scripts I use to generate the test cases, but I need to make sure that doing so wouldn't damage my 'academic integrity'.
