#FAQ

### Lol what's this repo for
Sample input and output to help you test your Spring 2012 CS240 assignments (at the time of this writing I'm a student in that class).

### You sure the outputs for assignment *n* are correct?
Some of the same input/output is taken directly from the assignment specs. The rest (both input and output) is generated by a python script I wrote, and then tested against my c++ assignment solution. I'll release the python script that does this once I get approval from the prof.

### How do I run the test cases?

Here's a test-running script I wrote for another project: [tests.py](https://github.com/cammckinnon/Parenthetic/blob/master/tests.py) - just modify line 22 so it runs your program instead of `python parenthetic.py` and put the tests in a ./tests direectory.
